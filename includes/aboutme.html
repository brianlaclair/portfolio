<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brian.</p>
<p>I'm probably going to tell you too much about myself, but first I wanted to make sure you know this: If there's anything you see on my portfolio that you have questions about, <b>please</b> reach out to me by using the contact information at the bottom of this page! I truly am happy to talk in-depth about things I've worked on beyond what the scope of this site allows for.</p>
<p>Okay, so onto me! I started coding when I was a kid (by finding an ancient QBASIC executable when I was 9) and haven't stopped since. I've always been fascinated by making things, and to me, programming is an avenue where the physical barriers of creating things are stripped away and you can have unparalleled levels of creative possibility spring to life.</p>
<p>In high school, I participated in many <a href="https://www.acsl.org/">American Computer Science League</a> challenges as well as writing code to autonomously control robots through my school's <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FIRST Technical Challenge</a> team (we even made it to the international championship in St. Louis, Missouri, USA!)</p>
<p>After highschool I attended the <a href="https://ccv.edu/">Community College of Vermont</a> studying Business before starting a wonderful 6-year long career in Parks & Recreation Management. Through that career, I gained a plethora of experience including budgeting, grant writing and management, and of course, effectively managing teams filled with exceptionally talented individuals.</p>
<p>Through that time, my passion for programming and creating never ceased, and most days I'd come home excited to put a few hours into whatever side-project I was working on at the time.</p><p>In early 2021, I was afforded the priviledge to go full-time as a freelance game developer and decided to take that opportunity!</p>
