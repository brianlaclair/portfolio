	"section1":  "<p>Skyland Online is a really interesting one - this entry was made for the GM48 game jam. Every asset and line of code in the project was created in 48 hours and we even managed to have a globally-playable massive online game ready for the deadline!</p><p>My main task in this project was to build all of the networking features - this included building functions for the game that make API calls to our server software, and building the server software itself. This was additionally complex as, in addition to sending usernames and coordinates, one of the main mechanics of the game was each player having a floating island that could be anywhere from 1 X 1 to ∞ X ∞ in size and completely destructable.</p><p>Since this was a GameMaker-specific game jam, I had to make the server in GameMaker Studio 2 - and in that short window of time I was able to build a solid system that allowed at least 20 players (the most we ever had on at one time) from around the world to play our game with each other in real-time.</p><p>I'm no longer hosting the server for this game, but if you're interested in playing it - please feel free to reach out via the contact form and we can setup a time to play together!</p>",
