	"section1":  "<p>While playing with online functionality for a few projects, I had the idea of an incredibly tiny world that could allow for a ton of players to show up at anytime - that's how Idyll was born.</p><p>Idyll was (is?) a virtual world that allows players to destroy objects, get resources, build new things, and repeat.</p><p>It can be played alone, or with friends, but anytime someone jumps into Idyll they are on the same island with the same amount of resources - the server I wrote for this allows for a finite number of rocks, pieces of wood, etc, meaning that at some point, you will have to break things to make new things.</p>",
