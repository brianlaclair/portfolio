	"section1":  "<p>GMHue is a small project that allows GameMaker Studio 2 games to leverage connectivity to Philips Hue smart lights.</p><p>It allows your game to dynamically set the color, brightness, and on / off state of lights that the user gives you control over to create a more ambient experience for your games.</p><p>In my mind, the best use for this would be when you're showcasing a game at a convention or meet-up to really excite visitors about the game they are playing by setting a dynamic mood for the demo.</p>",
