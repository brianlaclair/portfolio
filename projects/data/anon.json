	"section1":  "<p>Developed on a lazy Saturday afternoon, anon-chat is just a random attempt at an anonymous chat web app.</p><p>It's more or less an API written in PHP, with a front-end that sends requests to the API using JQuery to learn more about it's state, and what it should be doing.</p><p>My two favorite features of this app is that:</p><p>1. Your message color is what tells other users who you are relative to other messages.</p><p>2. You can start a new chatroom with ANY name just by typing it into the address bar.</p>",
