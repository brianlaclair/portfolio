Ah yes, \"with great power comes great responsibility\"... or was it \"just because you can, doesn't mean you should\"?</p><p>Anyway, VSWS is a web server software that I made with GameMaker Studio 2 - it is HTTP1.1 compliant, and has an extension to support co-processors like PHP, Python, or Perl when desired.</p><p>To complete this process I had to read a TON of documentation and RFC's on HTTP which helped me gain a deep understanding of the protocol and what's going on when you ask to visit a website.</p><p>Currently, there are about 30 different sites around the internet being hosted with VSWS.</p>",
