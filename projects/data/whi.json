As this was while I was in highschool, I didn't have any funding to keep up with changing technologies of the time and this project moved to the backburner.</p><p>Still, the site was heavily utilized - it averaged at 5,000 file uploads per day and was shared on the front page of Reddit several times.</p><p>Sadly, while it's rather easy to make a site like this today, I no longer have the WillHost.It source code and archive.org does not have the most up-to-date versions - hence why there are two identical screenshots on this page!</p>",
